# IBM-Data-Science Professional Certificate
**Professional Certificate - 12-Course Series**

I am preparing for a career in the high-growth field of data science. Through this program, I will develop the skills, tools, and portfolio needed to gain a competitive edge in the job market as an entry-level data scientist in as little as 4 months. No prior knowledge of computer science or programming languages is required.  

Data science involves gathering, cleaning, organizing, and analyzing data to extract helpful insights and predict outcomes. The demand for skilled data scientists who can tell compelling stories through data and inform business decisions is greater than ever.  

In this program, I will learn in-demand skills used by professional data scientists, including databases, data visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data mining. I’ll work with the latest languages, tools, and libraries, such as Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, RStudio, Pandas, NumPy, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, and more.  

By completing the full program, I will build a portfolio of data science projects, giving me the confidence to excel in interviews. Additionally, I’ll gain access to IBM’s Talent Network, where I can see job opportunities as they are posted, get recommendations matched to my skills and interests, and receive tips and tricks to stand out from the crowd.  

This program is ACE® and FIBAA recommended. Upon completion, I can earn up to 12 college credits and 6 ECTS credits.  

**Applied Learning Project**  

This Professional Certificate emphasizes applied learning, with hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud to provide me with practical skills applicable to real jobs. I’ll also have the option to explore how generative AI tools and techniques are used in data science.  

**Tools I’ll use**:  
- Jupyter / JupyterLab  
- GitHub  
- RStudio  
- Watson Studio  

**Libraries I’ll use**:  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Folium  
- ipython-sql  
- Scikit-learn  
- SciPy  

**Projects I’ll complete**:  
- Extract and graph financial data with the Pandas Python library.  
- Use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic datasets.  
- Wrangle data, graph plots, and create regression models to predict housing prices using data science Python libraries.  
- Create a dynamic Python dashboard to improve US domestic flight reliability.  
- Apply machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off.  
- Train and compare machine learning models.
